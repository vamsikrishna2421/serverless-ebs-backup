# Serverless EBS Volume Snapshots using Lambda Functions
Taking `EBS` snapshots is often a routine activity that is well suited to be automated using Lambda functions. So we are going to write a simple Boto3 script to trigger EBS Snapshots using AWS Lambda Functions


In 3 simple steps, we are going to setup our serverless backup automation,
- **Step 1** - Setup Lambda Function - The Lambda Function will, (_`code` given below_)
  - Find out `Instances` in the current `Region`
  - Filter Instances based on `Tags` - In this case the key should be "**Backup** or "**backup**"
  - Identify block devices attached to those instances
  - Initiate Backup
  - Add Tags to Snapshots
  - Report Status
- **Step 2** - Configure Lambda Triggers - Cloudwatch Events
- **Step 3** - Verify EBS Snapshots in `EC2 Dashboard`

![Fig : Automated-Backup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vamsikrishna2421/serverless-ebs-backup/master/images/Serverless-Backup.jpg)

We will need the following pre-requisites to successfully complete this activity,
## Pre-Requisities
- EC2 Server(s) - with Tag "Key = BackUp" and "Value = Yes" _Remember the tag is case sensitive_
- IAM Role - _i.e_ `Lambda Service Role` - _with_ `EC2FullAccess` _permissions_


## Step 1 - Lambda Backup Code
Create a AWS Lambda Function, and choose `Python 2.7` as the runtime and copy paste the below code.

_Change the global variables at the top of the script to suit your needs. For example change the default Rentention period the Backup Tag to filter etc_
```py
import boto3
import collections
import datetime


# Set the global variables
globalVars  = {}
globalVars['Owner']                 = "Vamsi"
globalVars['Environment']           = "Test"
globalVars['REGION_NAME']           = "ap-south-1"
globalVars['tagName']               = "Serverless-Automated-Backup"
globalVars['findNeedle']            = "BackUp"
globalVars['RetentionTag']          = "DeleteOn"
globalVars['RetentionInDays']       = "70"

#Please mention your region name
ec = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='ap-south-1')

def backup_bot():

    snapsCreated = { 'Snapshots':[], }

    filters = [
        {'Name': 'tag-key', 'Values': [ globalVars['findNeedle'] ]},
        {'Name': 'tag-value', 'Values': ['Yes']},
    ]

    reservations = ec.describe_instances( Filters=filters ).get( 'Reservations', [] )

    instances = sum(
        [
            [i for i in r['Instances']]
            for r in reservations
        ], [])

    # print "Number of the Instances : %d" % len(instances)
    snapsCreated['InstanceCount']=len(instances)

    to_tag = collections.defaultdict(list)

    # Iterate for all Instances in the Region
    for instance in instances:
        try:
            retention_days = [
                int(t.get('Value')) for t in instance['Tags']
                if t['Key'] == 'Retention'][0]
        except IndexError:
            retention_days = int(globalVars['RetentionInDays'])

        # Get all the Block Device Mappings
        for dev in instance['BlockDeviceMappings']:
            if dev.get('Ebs', None) is None:
                continue
            vol_id = dev['Ebs']['VolumeId']

            # Iterate Tags to collect the instance name tag
            DescriptionTxt = ''
            for tag in instance['Tags']:
                if tag['Key'] == 'Name' :
                    DescriptionTxt = tag['Value']

            snap = ec.create_snapshot( VolumeId=vol_id, Description=DescriptionTxt )

            to_tag[retention_days].append(snap['SnapshotId'])

            # Tag all the snaps that were created today with Deletion Date
            # Processing "DeleteOn" here to allow for future case of each disk having its own Retention date
            for retention_days in to_tag.keys():
                delete_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=retention_days)
                # to mention the current date formet
                delete_fmt = delete_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
                # below code is create the name and current date as instance name
                ec.create_tags(
                                Resources=to_tag[retention_days],
                                Tags=[
                                        {'Key': globalVars['RetentionTag'], 'Value': delete_fmt},
                                        {'Key': 'Name', 'Value': snap['Description'] },
                                    ]
                            )
                snapsCreated['Snapshots'].append({ 'SnapshotId':snap['SnapshotId'], 'VolumeId' : vol_id, 'InstanceId' : instance['InstanceId'], 'DeleteOn': delete_fmt })

        to_tag.clear()

    return snapsCreated


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return backup_bot()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    lambda_handler(None, None)
```

## Step 2 - Configure `Cloudwatch Event` Lambda Triggers
We are going to use Cloudwatch Scheduled Events to take backup everyday.
```
rate(1 minute)
or
rate(5 minutes)
or
rate(1 day)
or
# The below example creates a rule that is triggered every day at 12:00pm UTC.
cron(0 12 * * ? *)
```
_If you want to learn more about the above Scheduled expressions,_ Ref: [CloudWatch - Schedule Expressions for Rules](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html#RateExpressions)

## Step 3 - Verify EBS Snapshots in Dashboard

## Customizations
You can use many of the lamdba configurations to customize it suit your needs,

- `Concurrency`:_Increase as necessary to manage all your instances_
- `Memory` & `Timeout`: _If you have a large number of instances, you want to increase the `Memory` & `Timeout`_
- `Security`: _Run your lambda inside your `VPC` for added security_
  - `CloudTrail` : _You can also enable `CloudTrail` for audit & governance_
